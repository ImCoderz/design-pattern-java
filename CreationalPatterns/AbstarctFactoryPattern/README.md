## Description

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational pattern that deals with the concept of families of related or dependent objects, providing an interface for creating these objects without specifying their concrete classes. This promotes the creation of families of objects that work together seamlessly.

## Comparison with Factory Pattern

- **Scope:**
  - The Factory Pattern creates individual objects, while the Abstract Factory Pattern creates families of related or dependent objects.
  
- **Flexibility:**
  - The Abstract Factory Pattern is more flexible, allowing the creation of multiple related objects in a family, whereas the Factory Pattern creates a single object.

- **Complexity:**
  - The Abstract Factory Pattern is often more complex than the Factory Pattern due to the creation of multiple interrelated objects.
