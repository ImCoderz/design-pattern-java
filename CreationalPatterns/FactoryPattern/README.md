# Factory Pattern

## Overview

This repository illustrates the Factory Pattern, a design pattern that provides an interface for creating instances of a class but allows subclasses to alter the type of instances that will be created.

## Description

The Factory Pattern is a creational pattern that promotes loose coupling by allowing the client code to interact with an interface for creating objects. Subclasses can then implement this interface to provide concrete implementations of objects, enabling flexibility in object creation without modifying the client code.
