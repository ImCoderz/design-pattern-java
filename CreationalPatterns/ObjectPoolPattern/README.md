# Object Pool Pattern

## Overview

This repository illustrates the Object Pool Pattern, a design pattern that enhances performance and resource utilization by reusing objects rather than creating new ones.

## Description

The Object Pool Pattern is a creational pattern that manages a pool of reusable objects, eliminating the need for creating and destroying objects frequently. It enhances performance and resource utilization by reusing existing objects, especially in scenarios where object creation is expensive.

## Good Use Cases

1. **Database Connection Pools:**
   - The Object Pool Pattern is commonly used in scenarios where establishing and closing connections to a database can be resource-intensive.

2. **Thread Pools:**
   - In multithreaded environments, the Object Pool Pattern can be applied to manage and reuse threads, preventing the overhead of creating new threads frequently.

3. **Reusable Components:**
   - For components with high initialization costs, such as network connections or heavy-duty computational objects, the Object Pool Pattern is beneficial for reusing instances.
