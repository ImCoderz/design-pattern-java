Explanation:

1. **Volatile Keyword (`private static volatile Singleton instance`):** The `volatile` keyword ensures that any thread accessing the `instance` variable sees the most recent modification. This is crucial for the correctness of the double-checked locking mechanism.

2. **Private Constructor (`private Singleton()`):** The constructor is marked as private to prevent the instantiation of the Singleton class from outside. This ensures that the only way to get an instance is through the `getInstance()` method.

3. **Public `getInstance()` Method (`public static Singleton getInstance()):** This method is used to get the instance of the Singleton class. It follows the double-checked locking pattern for thread safety and lazy initialization.

4. **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is only created when it is needed, i.e., when `getInstance()` is called for the first time.

5. **Double-Checked Locking:** The double-checked locking pattern is used to ensure that only one thread can create an instance of the Singleton class at a time. The initial check outside the synchronized block helps to improve performance by avoiding synchronization overhead if the instance is already created.

6. **Synchronized Block (`synchronized (Singleton.class)`):** The synchronized block ensures that only one thread at a time can execute the critical section of code within the block. This is essential to prevent multiple threads from creating multiple instances of the Singleton class simultaneously.

7. **Double-Check Inside Synchronized Block:** Even though we checked for null outside the synchronized block, it's important to check again inside the block. This is because another thread might have acquired the lock and created the instance while the current thread was waiting for the lock.

8. **Return the Singleton Instance:** Finally, the method returns the instance of the Singleton class.

9. **Other Methods and Variables:** The class can contain additional methods and variables as needed for the application.

Remember that while this implementation ensures thread safety and lazy initialization, it may have some performance implications due to the use of synchronization. Depending on the specific requirements, alternative approaches like the "Bill Pugh Singleton" or using an enum may be considered.
