The Bill Pugh Singleton, also known as the Initialization-on-demand holder idiom, is a way to implement the Singleton pattern in Java that provides lazy initialization while being thread-safe. This approach takes advantage of the fact that inner classes are not loaded until they are referenced, allowing for a clean and efficient way to implement a Singleton.

Explanation:

1. **Private Constructor (`private Singleton()):** The constructor is marked as private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.

2. **Static Inner Class (`private static class SingletonHolder):** This is a static inner class that holds the instance of the Singleton. It is only loaded into memory when the `getInstance()` method is called for the first time.

3. **Private Static Final Instance (`private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton()):** The Singleton instance is created in a thread-safe manner inside the static inner class. The `final` keyword ensures that the instance cannot be changed after it has been initialized.

4. **Public `getInstance()` Method (`public static Singleton getInstance()):** This method provides a way to access the Singleton instance. When this method is called, it triggers the loading of the `SingletonHolder` class and, consequently, the creation of the Singleton instance.

The Bill Pugh Singleton takes advantage of the Java class loader's guarantees about class initialization to ensure that the Singleton instance is created in a thread-safe and lazy manner. This approach is often preferred over traditional double-checked locking, as it is simpler and avoids some of the pitfalls associated with double-checked locking in certain scenarios.
