## Overview

This repository illustrates the Prototype Pattern, a design pattern that creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

## Description

The Prototype Pattern is a creational pattern that focuses on creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating an object is more expensive or complex than copying an existing one.

## Good Use Cases

1. **Configuration Objects:**
   - When creating objects with a complex configuration, using prototypes can efficiently create new instances with similar configurations.

2. **Cloning in Games:**
   - In game development, the Prototype Pattern can be applied to clone objects like characters, weapons, or vehicles with specific attributes.

3. **Document Generation:**
   - For systems generating complex documents, the Prototype Pattern can be used to create copies with minor variations, reducing the effort required for document generation.
