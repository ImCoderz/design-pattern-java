## Introduction

Understanding design patterns is a crucial aspect of software development. This repository serves as a learning resource for fellow students and developers interested in Java and design patterns. Each pattern implementation includes detailed explanations, UML diagrams, and code snippets.

## Patterns Included

## Creational Patterns

1. **Abstract Factory Pattern:**
   - Illustrates the implementation of an abstract factory for creating themed GUI elements.

2. **Builder Pattern:**
   - Demonstrates the builder pattern in a burger-building scenario.

3. **Factory Pattern:**
   - Includes examples with Coffee and Vehicle factories.

4. **Object Pool Pattern:**
   - Presents an example of an object pool in a database context.

5. **Optimized Singleton Pattern:**
   - Provides two optimized implementations of the Singleton pattern.

6. **Prototype Pattern:**
   - Showcases the prototype pattern for creating graphic elements.

## Behavioral Patterns

1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:**
   - Demonstrates the chain of responsibility with an example involving request handling.

2. **Command Pattern:**
   - Shows the command pattern in a scenario involving command objects.

3. **Iterator Pattern:**
   - Illustrates the iterator pattern with an example of iterating over a collection.

4. **Mediator Pattern:**
   - Presents the mediator pattern in a scenario involving communication between components.

5. **Memento Pattern:**
   - Provides an example of the memento pattern for saving and restoring an object's state.

6. **Observer Pattern:**
   - Demonstrates the observer pattern with an example of a fitness app tracking workouts.

7. **State Pattern:**
   - Illustrates the state pattern in a vending machine scenario.

8. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - Shows the strategy pattern in a fitness app scenario, allowing users to choose workout strategies.

9. **Template Method Pattern:**
   - Provides an example of the template method pattern with a sandwich-making scenario.

10. **Visitor Pattern:**
    - Demonstrates the visitor pattern with an example of calculating areas of different geometric shapes.

Feel free to explore each pattern's example code and accompanying explanations to gain a deeper understanding of design patterns and their practical applications.
